  desc: <p>Visual instance-level recognition and retrieval are fundamental tasks in computer vision. Despite the recent advances in this field, most techniques have been evaluated on a limited number of domains; most recent papers report results solely for datasets based on landmarks (famous buildings, statues, mountains, waterfalls, etc), with a limited number of classes. We believe that the research community can benefit from a new suite of datasets and associated challenges, to improve the understanding about the limitations of current technology, and with an opportunity to introduce new techniques.</p> <p>The Instance-Level Recognition (ILR) Workshop is a follow-up of two successful editions of the Landmark Recognition Workshop at <a href="https://landmarksworkshop.github.io/CVPRW2018" target="_blank"><span class="navy"> CVPRW18 </span></a> and  <a href="https://landmarksworkshop.github.io/CVPRW2019" target="_blank"><span class="navy"> CVPRW19 </span></a> . While the previous editions focused solely on landmarks, the new Instance-Level Recognition workshop will consider three domains: artwork, landmarks and products.</p>
