Despite the recent advances in this field, many techniques have been evaluated on a limited number of domains, with small number of classes. We believe that the research community can benefit from a new suite of datasets and associated challenges, to improve the understanding about the limitations of current technology, and with an opportunity to introduce new techniques. </p><p>The Instance-Level Recognition (ILR) Workshop is a follow-up of two successful editions of the Landmark Recognition Workshop at <a href="https://landmarksworkshop.github.io/CVPRW2018" target="_blank"><span class="navy"> CVPRW18 </span></a> and  <a href="https://landmarksworkshop.github.io/CVPRW2019" target="_blank"><span class="navy"> CVPRW19 </span></a> . While the previous editions focused solely on landmarks, our Instance-Level Recognition workshop will consider three domains: artworks, landmarks and products.</p>
